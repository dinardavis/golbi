    question: "Why not just bring on a full-time developer?",
    answer: "Totally fair question. Hiring a full-time dev can run well over $100k per year—plus benefits, equipment, and onboarding time. With Golbi, you’re not locked into ongoing costs. You only pay when you’ve got actual projects in motion. Need a break? Just pause your plan and resume when you’re ready. No wasted budget. No downtime payroll.",

  {
    question: "Is there a cap on how many projects I can request?",
    answer: "Nope—there’s no set limit. Once you’re subscribed, you can send over as many project requests as you like via email. Golbi will work through them one by one, based on your priorities.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 2,

  {
    question: "How quickly will my work get done?",
    answer: "Turnaround times are discussed and agreed upon before kicking things off. Clear timelines, no surprises.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 3,
  },
  {
    question: "Who will I actually be working with?",
    answer: "When you hire Golbi, you work directly with me—the founder, designer, and developer behind it all. It’s a solo operation, which means full transparency and zero handoffs. If your project grows and needs more hands, I have a vetted network of pros I can tap into.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 4,
  },
  {
    question: "How does pausing my subscription work?",
    answer: "Not every month is packed with work—that’s expected. With Golbi, your subscription runs on a monthly cycle. If you only need 2 weeks, no problem. You can pause with your remaining days saved, ready to pick up whenever you return. You stay in control of your time and budget.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 5,
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms or tools do you use?",
    answer: "That depends entirely on your project. Golbi chooses the tools and tech stack that are best suited for your goals—no cookie-cutter solutions.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 6,
  },
  {
    question: "How do I submit my ideas or project requests?",
    answer: "It’s simple—just send your project details directly by email. You can describe the task, attach mockups, link to docs, or even record a short video. Whatever format helps you communicate your idea best is totally welcome.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 7,
  },
  {
    question: "What if I’m not happy with the result?",
    answer: "No problem at all. Golbi will revise and refine your project until you're fully satisfied. That’s the standard, not the exception.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 8,
  },
  {
    question: "What if I just have a one-off project?",
    answer: "That's when working with Golbi really comes in handy! You can either request a project based quote, or sign up for the monthly plan, and once your job is complete, just pause your plan. You can come back any time when new needs pop up. It’s completely flexible.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 9,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a refund if I change my mind?",
    answer: "Because of the nature and quality of the work, Golbi does not offer refunds. That said, the focus is always on making sure you’re happy with the outcome.",
