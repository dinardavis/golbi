    question: "Why not just bring on a full-time developer?",
    answer: "Most small businesses don’t need a full-time developer, and hiring one can run well over $100k per year—plus benefits, equipment, and onboarding time. With Golbi, we’re here when you need work done, then you can pause. ",

  {
    question: "Is there a cap on how many projects I can request?",
    answer: "Nope—there’s no set limit. Once you’re subscribed, you keep sending, and we keep building.",

  {
    question: "How quickly will my work get done?",
    answer: "Turnaround times are discussed and agreed upon before kicking things off. Clear timelines, no surprises.",

  },
  {
    question: "Who will I actually be working with?",
    answer: "When you hire Golbi, you work directly with me—the owner/operator. I have a decade plus of experience copywriting, designing and developing for brands like, General Motors, Disney, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble. So you're in good hands. And if your project grows, I have a vetted network of pros I can tap into as well.",
    showAnswer: false,

  },
  {
    question: "How does pausing my subscription work?",
    answer: "Not every month is packed with work—that’s expected. With Golbi, your subscription runs on a monthly cycle. If you only need 2 weeks, no problem. You can pause with your remaining days saved, ready to pick up whenever you return. You stay in control of your time and budget.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 5,
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms or tools do you use?",
    answer: "That depends entirely on your project. Golbi chooses the tools and tech stack that are best suited for your goals—no cookie-cutter solutions.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 6,
  },
  {
    question: "How do I submit my ideas or project requests?",
    answer: "It’s simple—just send your project details directly by email. You can describe the task, attach mockups, link to docs, or even record a short video. Whatever format helps you communicate your idea best is totally welcome.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 7,
  },
  {
    question: "What if I’m not happy with the result?",
    answer: "No problem at all. Golbi will revise and refine your project until you're fully satisfied.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 8,
  },
  {
    question: "What if I just have a one-off project?",
    answer: "That's when working with Golbi really comes in handy! You can either request a project based quote, or sign up for the monthly plan, and once your job is complete, just pause your plan. You can come back any time when new needs pop up. It’s completely flexible.",
    showAnswer: false,
    id: 9,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a refund if I change my mind?",
    answer: "Because of the quality of the work, Golbi does not offer refunds. That being said, the focus is always on making sure you’re happy with the outcome.",
