    question: "Why not just hire a full-time developer?",
    answer:
      "Most small businesses don’t need a full-time dev—and hiring one can cost well over $100k/year. Golbi delivers fast, expert work only when you need it, with no long-term commitment or overhead.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Can I still get ongoing support if I need it?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Every build comes with a 14-day post-launch window for tweaks and questions. If you’d like more long-term support, flexible monthly plans are available for updates, landing pages, or new features.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What if I just have a one-off project?",
    answer:
      "Perfect. Most Golbi clients start with a flat-fee project like a website build or redesign. Once it’s live, you're free to walk away—or stick around for ongoing support as needed.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer:
      "Timelines vary depending on scope, but most projects are completed in 1–3 weeks. You’ll get a clear start date and timeline upfront—no surprises.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Who will I be working with?",
    answer:
      "You’ll work directly with me—Dinar, Golbi’s founder. I bring over a decade of experience in writing, design, and dev for brands like Disney, GM, and P&G. You’re in good hands from day one.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Do you use templates or AI tools?",
    answer:
      "Nope. Every project is custom-built for your brand and business goals. If a tool helps streamline something behind the scenes, great—but the output is always handcrafted and intentional.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What platforms or tech do you use?",
    answer:
      "That depends on your project. Golbi is platform-agnostic—we’ll choose the right tools based on your goals, budget, and how much control you want after handoff.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "How do I share my project idea?",
    answer:
      "You can email a description, share a doc, or even record a Loom video. Whatever makes it easiest to explain what you need, Golbi will take it from there.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "What if I want changes after launch?",
    answer:
      "No worries. You’ll have a 14-day window to request any edits or refinements. After that, you can either book one-off help or hop on a monthly support plan.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Do you offer refunds?",
    answer:
      "Due to the nature of custom work, refunds aren’t offered. But the goal is always to get it right—and revisions are always part of the process.",
    showAnswer: false,
  },
